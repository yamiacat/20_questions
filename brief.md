# Socket.io Lab

Practice creating a real time app using Socket.io and React.

## Option 1

Make the game 20 Questions using the start point we have provided for you.

The Chooser thinks of a celebrity and the Guesser tries to guess the chosen celebrity by asking Yes/No questions.

The GuesserContainer should emit question events and listens for answer events
The ChooserContainer should listen for question events and emit answer events

You will need the server to listen for and reemit both question and answer events.

### Extension
Refactor the GameContainer to use React Router to select the game role

## Option 2

Make anything else you like with Socket.io and React
